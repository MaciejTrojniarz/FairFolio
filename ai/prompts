You will act as world-class product owner and we will be working on Product Requirement Document for my next project. Main problem I want to solve is to address the needs of the merchant on fantasy conventions / trades. I want to have app with authentication so I could keep my sales and inventory data for my own. Application would support multitenancy so each of the tenant must be separated regarding the data. I want to have easy to use mobile first app that would allow me to trach all of my sales during the events. Ideally with touch interface which would be mobile/tablet friendly. System would need to work offline as there is often connectivity problems during the fantasy fairs. I want to be able to track all of the costs related to book fairs/ fantasy conventions that I will attend as a mechant. I want to track upcoming and past events having nice overview over financial results of them. Create a document in the project called 'prompts' where you will be dumping all of the prompts with the reference to the actual files you will have interfere with.

Let's go and create tech_stack.md file to capture stack of the application. I'm fullstack engineer with knowledge of JavaScript/Typescript and React on frontend and mostly Java on the backend but I don't mind learning JavaScript on the backend as well.
