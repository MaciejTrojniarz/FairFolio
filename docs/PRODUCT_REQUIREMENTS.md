## 1. Introduction & Problem Statement

Merchants at fantasy conventions, comic-cons, and trade fairs operate in a dynamic and often challenging environment. They require a simple, reliable tool to manage their business on-the-go. Key challenges include unreliable internet connectivity on convention floors, the need for rapid transaction processing, and the difficulty of tracking both sales and event-related expenses in one place.

**FaireFolio** is a mobile-first application designed specifically for these merchants. It will provide a robust, offline-capable system for tracking sales, inventory, and event costs, ensuring that each merchant's data is private, secure, and always accessible.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

*   **Primary Goal:** To provide convention merchants with a self-contained, reliable mobile application to manage sales, inventory, and event finances, even when offline.
*   **Business Objective:** Capture the market of small-to-medium merchants at specialized trade events by offering a tailored, user-friendly solution.
*   **User Objective:** To replace unreliable methods (e.g., spreadsheets, notebooks) with a single app that simplifies event-based business management and provides clear financial overviews.
*   **MVP Focus:** The initial version must prioritize the speed and simplicity of recording a multi-item sale above all other functions.

## 3. User Personas

**Name:** Alex "The Artificer" Chen
**Role:** Independent Artist & Merchant
**Bio:** Alex sells prints, pins, and custom-bound notebooks at 10-15 fantasy and comic conventions per year. They currently use a combination of a laptop spreadsheet (when power is available), a physical cash box, and a separate notes app to track expenses like booth fees, travel, and lodging. Internet is a constant struggle. Alex needs to know which events are most profitable to plan their schedule for the next year.

**Name:** Elara Vance, The Story Weaver
**Role:** Self-Published Fantasy Author
**Bio:** Elara travels to book fairs and fantasy conventions to sell her series of paperback novels. Her inventory is simpler than Alex's but tracking which specific titles sell best at which events is critical for deciding on print runs. She needs to manage her stock carefully and wants a straightforward way to see her net profit after accounting for travel and printing costs for each event.


## 4. Feature Requirements (Expanded Scope)

This version of the product includes a broader set of features, acknowledging that the development timeline will be adjusted to accommodate them.

### 4.1. User & Tenant Management
*   **As a merchant, I want to create a secure account** so that my business data is private.
*   **As a merchant, I want to log in to my account** to access my information.
*   **System Requirement:** The system must enforce strict data separation between tenants.
*   *Backend:* Supabase will be used for authentication and user data management.

### 4.2. Product & Sales Management
*   **As a merchant, I want to add my products (name, price, cost) into the app** so I can easily select them during a sale.
*   **As a merchant, I want to organize my products into categories and see them as thumbnails** so I can find items visually and quickly.
*   **As a merchant, I want to record a multi-item sale** so I can quickly process transactions.
*   **As a merchant, I want my inventory levels to update automatically after each sale** so I know what I have in stock.

### 4.3. Event & Financial Tracking
*   **As a merchant, I want to create an entry for an event** (e.g., "DragonCon 2025") with properties like name, description, link, date range, venue, and city.
*   **As a merchant, I want to log all business expenses related to an event** (e.g., booth fee, travel, materials, lodging) so I can calculate my true profit.
*   **As a merchant, I want to view a financial summary for each event,** showing total revenue, total costs, and net profit/loss.
*   **As a merchant, I want to see a list of my past and upcoming events** to track my business over time.
*   **As a merchant, I want to export the sales and cost data for a single event to a CSV file** so I can analyze it in other tools.

### 4.4. Data Synchronization
*   **Offline-First:** The application must be fully functional without an internet connection for sales recording.
*   **Data Synchronization:** When a connection becomes available, the app should automatically sync the locally stored data. The system will be event-based. In case of data conflicts from multiple offline devices, the system will flag the conflict and provide the user with tools for manual resolution (compensation commands) once online.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Offline-First:** The application must be fully functional without an internet connection for sales recording.
*   **Data Synchronization:** When a connection becomes available, the app should automatically sync the locally stored data. The system will be event-based. In case of data conflicts from multiple offline devices, the system will flag the conflict and provide the user with tools for manual resolution (compensation commands) once online.
*   **Platform:** Mobile-first (iOS & Android), with a responsive design that also works well on tablets.
*   **UI/UX:** The interface must be clean, intuitive, and optimized for touch. The sales interface should be designed for continuous, all-day operation, featuring a category-based, tap-driven navigation with visual thumbnails to facilitate rapid item selection.
*   **Security:** User data will be secured via Supabase authentication.

## 6. Success Metrics

*   Achieve an initial user base of at least 6 active merchants within the first 6 months post-launch.
*   Average number of transactions recorded per user per event.
*   User satisfaction score (measured via in-app feedback).
*   Maintain a positive user sentiment, reflected in good app store ratings (e.g., an average of 4 stars or higher).

## 7. Out of Scope (for Version 1.0)

*   Direct credit card processing. (Users will use external hardware like Square/SumUp and log the sale in-app).
*   Multi-user access for a single tenant/shop.
*   Advanced inventory management (e.g., purchase orders, supplier tracking).
*   E-commerce website integration.

## 8. Project Constraints

*   **Team:** Single senior developer with assistance from AI agents.
*   **Timeline for MVP:** To be determined based on expanded scope.
