## 1. Introduction & Problem Statement

Merchants at fantasy conventions, comic-cons, and trade fairs operate in a dynamic and often challenging environment. They require a simple, reliable tool to manage their business on-the-go. Key challenges include unreliable internet connectivity on convention floors, the need for rapid transaction processing, and the difficulty of tracking both sales and event-related expenses in one place.

**FaireFolio** is a mobile-first application designed specifically for these merchants. It will provide a robust, offline-capable system for tracking sales, inventory, and event costs, ensuring that each merchant's data is private, secure, and always accessible.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

*   **Primary Goal:** To provide convention merchants with a self-contained, reliable mobile application to manage sales, inventory, and event finances, even when offline.
*   **Business Objective:** Capture the market of small-to-medium merchants at specialized trade events by offering a tailored, user-friendly solution.
*   **User Objective:** To replace unreliable methods (e.g., spreadsheets, notebooks) with a single app that simplifies event-based business management and provides clear financial overviews.
*   **MVP Focus:** The initial version must prioritize the speed and simplicity of recording a multi-item sale above all other functions.

## 3. User Personas

**Name:** Alex "The Artificer" Chen
**Role:** Independent Artist & Merchant
**Bio:** Alex sells prints, pins, and custom-bound notebooks at 10-15 fantasy and comic conventions per year. They currently use a combination of a laptop spreadsheet (when power is available), a physical cash box, and a separate notes app to track expenses like booth fees, travel, and lodging. Internet is a constant struggle. Alex needs to know which events are most profitable to plan their schedule for the next year.

**Name:** Elara Vance, The Story Weaver
**Role:** Self-Published Fantasy Author
**Bio:** Elara travels to book fairs and fantasy conventions to sell her series of paperback novels. Her inventory is simpler than Alex's but tracking which specific titles sell best at which events is critical for deciding on print runs. She needs to manage her stock carefully and wants a straightforward way to see her net profit after accounting for travel and printing costs for each event.


## 4. MVP Scope (40-hour)

This Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is strictly scoped to be achievable within approximately 40 hours of development time by a single senior developer with AI assistance. It focuses on the absolute core functionality required for a merchant to record sales.

### 4.1. User & Tenant Management
*   **As a merchant, I want to create a secure account** so that my business data is private.
*   **As a merchant, I want to log in to my account** to access my information.
*   **System Requirement:** The system must enforce strict data separation between tenants.
*   *Backend:* Supabase will be used for authentication and user data management.

### 4.2. Basic Product & Sales Management
*   **As a merchant, I want to add my products (name, price) into the app** so I can easily select them during a sale.
*   **As a merchant, I want to record a multi-item sale** so I can quickly process transactions.
*   **System Requirement:** All sales and product data will be stored locally on the device.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements (for MVP)

*   **Offline-First:** The application must be fully functional without an internet connection for sales recording.
*   **Platform:** Mobile-first (iOS & Android), with a responsive design that works on tablets.
*   **UI/UX:** The interface will be functional and optimized for quick sales entry, prioritizing speed over visual polish or advanced navigation (e.g., no thumbnails or categories in this MVP).
*   **Security:** User data will be secured via Supabase authentication.

## 6. Success Metrics (for MVP)

*   Achieve an initial user base of at least 6 active merchants within the first 6 months post-launch.
*   Maintain a positive user sentiment, reflected in good app store ratings (e.g., an average of 4 stars or higher).

## 7. Out of Scope (for 40-hour MVP)

*   **Advanced Product Management:** Product categories, product images/thumbnails.
*   **Inventory Management:** Automatic inventory level updates.
*   **Cloud Synchronization:** Any form of cloud sync for sales data, event-based systems, or conflict resolution. Data remains local to the device.
*   **Event & Financial Tracking:** Creating events, logging costs, viewing financial summaries, and CSV export.
*   **Direct Payment Processing:** (Already out of scope).
*   **Multi-user access for a single tenant/shop:** (Already out of scope).
*   **E-commerce website integration:** (Already out of scope).

## 8. Project Constraints

*   **Team:** Single senior developer with assistance from AI agents.
*   **Timeline for MVP:** Approximately 40 hours of work. **Note:** The current feature set (including authentication, multitenancy, event-based sync, categories/thumbnails, and CSV export) is highly ambitious and likely not achievable within this 40-hour timeframe for a single developer.
