## Title: Define 40-hour MVP Scope

## Status: Accepted

## Context

The project has a strict constraint of approximately 40 hours of development time by a single senior developer with AI assistance. The initial product requirements were broader than what is achievable within this timeline.

## Decision

The MVP scope will be highly constrained to focus on the absolute core functionality: basic user authentication and multitenancy, basic product management (name, price), and offline multi-item sales recording. Cloud synchronization, advanced UI features (thumbnails, categories), event/financial tracking, and data export are explicitly out of scope for this 40-hour MVP.

## Consequences

### Positive
*   **Achievable Timeline:** Increases the likelihood of delivering a functional product within the 40-hour constraint.
*   **Focused Development:** Allows the developer to concentrate on the most critical features.
*   **Early Feedback:** Enables early user testing of the core value proposition.

### Negative
*   **Limited Functionality:** Many desired features are deferred, potentially impacting initial user satisfaction or perceived completeness.
*   **Future Refactoring:** Features deferred from the MVP might require architectural changes or refactoring when implemented later.
*   **No Cloud Sync:** Data remains local to the device, requiring manual backup/transfer for users and limiting data analysis capabilities until a later phase.

## Alternatives Considered

*   **Maintain Broader Scope:** Would lead to an incomplete or non-functional product within the 40-hour timeline.
*   **Increase Timeline/Resources:** Would allow for a broader MVP but contradicts the current project constraints.
